Personal loans are a lucrative revenue stream for banks.  The typical interest rate of a two-year loan in the United Kingdom is [around 10%](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/whats-a-good-interest-rate-for-a-personal-loan/).
## Objective:
The objective of this project is to clean, reformat, and split the data collected by a bank during a recent marketing campaign into three distinct CSV files (client.csv, campaign.csv, and economics.csv). The cleaned data will follow specific formatting and data type requirements so that it can be seamlessly imported into a PostgreSQL database for future analysis. The cleaned data will also support upcoming marketing campaigns aimed at encouraging clients to take personal loans.
